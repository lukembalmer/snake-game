Do not play if you have epilepsy or are similarly sensitive to flashing lights- the console window flickers rapidly, I don't believe there's a fix for it at the level I'm at.

A quick game in C++, took maybe a few hours over an evening but it's my first time working on a real game/project, even with how small it is. I'm proud!

Much of this code and the ideas behind it are from NVitanovic on Youtube. I did not come up with everything in this program by myself, and his video was a very helpful starting point. However, I've made many alterations and improvements to his code, and coded alongside a video of his, rather than just copy/pasting.
The first video is here: https://youtu.be/E_-lMZDi7Uw
