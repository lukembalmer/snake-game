DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY OR ARE SIMILARLY SENSITIVE TO FLASHING LIGHTS- the flickering of the images is unavoidable in the console window.

A quick game in C++, took maybe a few hours over an evening but it's my first time working on a real game/project, even with how small it is. I'm proud!

Much of this code and the ideas behind it are from NVitanovic on Youtube. I do not claim this project as my own, since it contains code of his. However, I've made many alterations and improvements to his code, and coded alongside a video of his, rather than just copy/pasting.
The first video is here: https://youtu.be/E_-lMZDi7Uw
